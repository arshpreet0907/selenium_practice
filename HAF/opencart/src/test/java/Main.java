                         * OFF
                 * Appenders and Loggers :
                         * Appenders : where to generate the logs (console/file) : file is preferred
                         * Loggers : what type of logs generate (levels : ALL < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fetal < OFF)

                         * in rolling file we specify the name of file along with time stamp, so log files will be creating with time stamp in their name
                         * in appenders ref we specify where we like to put our data in either console or file
                         * in root we can specify any of the above logging levels
                         * if file size becomes more than specified it will create a new file with the over flowing logs

                         * create Logger object () -> import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
                         * instantiate the logger object using LoggerManager -> logger= LogManager.getLogger(this.getClass()); import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
                         * now use this logger object to call its methods and log specific levels and messages

         * 3) Run tests on desired browser/cross browser/parallel : xml files should be created at the project level
                 * steps :
                         * 1) Create testng.xml file to Run Test Cases and parameterize browser name and OS to BaseClass â†’setup() method.
                         * 2) Update BaseClass -setup() method, launch browser based on conditions.
                         * 3) Maintain separate xml to run tests multiple browsers parallelly.
                 * pass the parameter in BaseClass using xml file and using switch we can dynamically choose which browser to open
                 * os is changed using grid
                 * to run multiple test cases on different browsers we can make multiple tests in xml file and provide different parameters there along thread count at suite level along with parallel="tests"

                        * 2) Also add BaseClass methods setup() & teardown() to all groups.

                         * 3) Add ExtentReportUtility (Listener class) entry in testng.xml file.
                         * 4) Make sure WebDriver is static in BaseClass, we refer same driver instance in ExtentReportUtility
                 * Also we will add the screenshot feature on failure in base class we add a method to take test method name as input take screenshot and return the path of the screenshot
                 * In ExtentReportUtility we add the methods : onStart, onTestSuccess, on TestFailure, onTestSkipped, onFinish. adding the status, info, groups of each test case along with other functionalities
                 * adding the listener xml files
                 * we need to make the BaseClass web driver static because one instance is created when execution starts from setup,
                 * but when new BaseClass() is called a driver is used in captureScreenshot method, so if web driver is nonstatic a new driver can be made
                 * and conflict can be there, to avoid it make the web driver static so it is shared across all the instances of BaseClass under one execution
                 * intentionally fail any test to check if screenshot gets attached to the report

                         * when our xml file executes the test cases the failed test cases are stored automatically in a separate xml file in the test-output folder named testng-failed.xml

                                 * 1) docker ps : which containers are already running (container id, image, command, created, status, ports, names), some may be present but not running
                                 * 2) docker run image_name : this creates the container for the particular image, if present it just creates the container, if image not present then it first downloads the image then creates the container, created containers do not run by default
                                 * 3) docker start container_id : it makes the container running
                                 * 4) docker stop container_id : it makes the container stop
                                 * 5) docker rm container_id : it removes the container, we cannot remove the running container, stop it first
                                 * 6) docker run -it image_name : it enables us to interact with container and also makes a new container and runs it
                         * Others :
                                 * 1) docker stats : tells about docker container memory usage and other stats
                                 * 2) docker system df : tells disk usage of docker images, containers, local volumes, build cache : total, active, size, reclaimable
                                 * 3) docker system prune -f : force full stopping/remove of all docker containers

                 * here we will install 3 images (image names) :
                         * 1) hub : selenium/hub
                         * 2) linux-firefox : selenium/node-firefox
                         * 3) linux-chrome : selenium/node-chrome
                 * all 3 should be part of one network
                 * 1 hub and 2 nodes
                 * run images using following commands :
                         * Create a Docker Network
                                 * docker network create grid
                                         * grid is the network name
                                         * returns ID
                         * hub :
                                 * docker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --net grid --name selenium-hub selenium/hub
                                 * docker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --net grid --name selenium-hub selenium/hub:latest
                                         * 4442-4444:4442-4444 is the porting mechanism meaning assign port in the given range
                                         * grid is the name of network
                                         * selenium-hub is the name of node
                                         * selenium/hub is the image name
                                         * returns ID
                         * linux-chrome :
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-chrome
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub --shm-size="2g" -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-chrome:latest
                                         * grid is the network name
                                         * selenium/node-chrome is the image name
                                         * --shm-size="2g" : ?
                                         * returns ID
                         * linux-firefox :
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-firefox
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub --shm-size="2g" -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-firefox:latest
                                         * returns ID
                         * remove the network :
                                 * docker network rm grid
                 * stop containers after running tests
         * through this a network gets created, inside it a hub and two nodes of chrome and firefox are made and these containers also starts running
         * now grid environment is set up successfully now we can run our grid environment and see the nodes running, just open the http://localhost:4444/ui and hub along with nodes will be visible
         * create a xml file with parameters, listeners and everything we need, make sure that the properties file has execution_env=remote and we have a switch case for linux : Platform.LINUX
         * by default it will follow headless execution, report will be generated test wise
         * Problem with this approach :
                 * need to start and stop the hub and nodes manually each time one by one
                 * it can again be a tedious task to it every time
         * Solution :
                 * docker-compose.yaml file :
                 * it is a configuration file in which we can specify all the hub and nodes
                 * it is simple and shortcut way : need not to download images, start and stop containers manually
                 * can be placed at project level along with xml files or inside the resources folder
                 * we can add any number of nodes by just replacing the image name
                 * 1) create docker-compose.yaml file :
                         * specifying version, services (docker images to run), networks
                         * for each image we specify what we wrote in the command individually (image, ports, environment, networks)
                 * 2) run docker-compose.yaml file :
                         * docker-compose up
                 * 3) to check hub and nodes running state :
                         * http://localhost:4444/grid/console
                 * 4) to increase number of nodes
                         * docker-compose scale chrome=3
                 * 5) to stop the grid and cleanup the created container run :
                         * docker-compose down
         * Once we run this file our hub and nodes are operational, we can view them on the previous grid url, and then simply run our xml file the sessions will be created and executed as usual

                         * maven has 2 levels :
                                 * 1) within ide as extension
                                 * 2) OS level
                         * we need to install maven at operating system level
                         * Install Maven steps :
                                 * 1) Download Maven : https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi : 	apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.zip
                                 * 2) extract zip and place it accordingly(e.g. program files)
                                 * 3) copy the bin path and paste it in Environment Variables path section in System Variables
                                 * 4) verify installation use command : mvn -version
                                 * 5) At least java should be installed before maven
                         * to run using command prompt :
                                 * 1) open project location in cmd containing the pom.xml file (verify using dir command)
                                 * 2) run command : mvn test/mvn clean test(clean up the previous execution files)
                                 * 3) make sure pom.xml file has properly configured compiler and surefire plugins with right xml file to run
                 * 3) run.bat file :
                         * instead of using the command prompt command everytime we can just make a bat file and execute it
                         * it is a shell scripting file
                         * inside the project folder make the run.bat file (name can be customized) : windows batch file
                         * inside the bat file put the commands executed on cmd, save and exit :
                                 * 1) cd path_to_project_folder_containing_pom.xml_file
                                 * 2) mvn test
                         * double click on the bat file, it will execute the commands specified and run the tests
                         * again make sure pom.xml file has the right plugins and xml file configured

         * 13) Push the code to Git and Github repository :
                 * from here CI(continuous integration) part starts, using git, github and jenkins
                 * Technical teams :
                         * 1) development : multiple developer work on same feature, have their own local repository(git) on top of workspace(directory), at the end of day all changes need to be make part of local repository(commit) then push the code to global repository/remote repository(github) using website link
                         * 2) devops : (activities)
                                 * 1) build creation : using maven (maven goals : compile code, run code, test code, package, install), using process automation
                                 * 2) run automation : take the test scripts from testing team global repository, using Jenkins
                                 * 3) build certification : at the end this is generated
                                 * nightly builds : at night build is certified
                         * 3) testing : do similar to developers, make changes all day, at the end commit to local repository and then push it to global repository
                 * we will focus on testing team work :
                         * to commit tests to local repository
                         * to push to global repository
                         * to configure project inside Jenkins
                 * continuously jenkins will take the test cases from global repository and execute them
                 * Prerequisites :
                         * 1) install git
                                 * download git for particular operating system
                                 * install the exe file
                                 * verify git install by having a git command prompt (git bash,git gui)
                                         * git --version
                         * 2) make account in github
                                 * go to git hub website
                                 * create account fill all information
                                 * login into your account -> profile
                                 * create remote repository :
                                         * go to profile
                                         * go to repository
                                         * create new fill all details and click create
                                         * in the code section get the repository url
                 * workflow :
                         * directory phases :
                                 * working directory ->(add command) -> staging area -> (commit command) -> git repository -> (push command) -> github repository
                         * file phases :
                                 * Untracked file -> (add command) -> tracked file -> (commit command) -> commited file -> (push command) -> remote file
                         * project is created inside the working directory/workspace
                         * we have control over untracked and tracked files but commited files are permanent
                         * refer to images
                         * steps : (Round 1)
                                 * 1) create a new local git repository at same workspace/project location:
                                         * git init
                                 * 2) Provide user info to git repository
                                         * git config --global user.name "Arshpreet Singh"
                                         * git config --global user.email "arshpreet0907singh@gmail.com"
                                 * 3) Adding files/folders to staging/indexing
                                         * git add -A : add all the files and folders to staging
                                         * git add filename : particular file
                                         * git add *.java : all java files
                                         * git add folder_name : particular folder
                                                 * git add .        # Stages new_file.txt and modified_file.txt only
                                                 * git add -A       # Stages all three: new, modified, AND deleted files
                                                 * git add -u       # Stages only modified_file.txt and deleted_file.txt
                                 * Check status of files being tracked :
                                         * git status : files green are being tracked
                                 * 4) Commit the code into local(git) repository :
                                         * git commit -m "commit message"
                                 * 5) Establish connection between local and global repository before first push
                                         * git remote add origin "remote repository url"
                                 * 6) Push the code into remote repository :
                                         * git push origin master
                                 * create token for login :
                                 * github profile -> settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens -> tokens classic -> generate new token -> provide password -> provide note, expiration duration and select privileges (repo, admin.org, delete_repo, user, etc) for operations allowed, click on generate token, copy the token id and paste it to sign in window
                         * this all has to be done for round 1
                         * for round 2 steps :
                                 * check git status to know which files got created/changed/deleted(displayed with red)
                                 * 1) add the changed files
                                 * 2) commit the changes
                                 * 3) push the changes
                         * when some other person has push the changes to remote repository :
                                 * pull the new code to our local repository (when project already present in local as well as remote)
                                         * git pull "git_repo_url"   # first pull
                                         * git pull                  # from 2nd pull onwards
                                 * clone the remote repository (when remote repository does not exists locally, done only once)
                                         * git clone "git_repo_url"
                         * When multiple people are working on remote repository we maintain branches of git repository
                         * from the main branch we create branches and work separately we can push code there, then all branches can be merged together, if there are conflicts we can resolve them, it is called conflict resolution process

        /**
         * 14) Run tests using Jenkins :
                 * Devops : CI/CD process as infinity logo
                         * CI (Continuous Integration): developing, testing and building the project on every commit
                         * CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) : deploying the successful builds for the users
                 * Jenkins : used for CI/CD pipeline process automation
                         * it is in devops team domain and a web based application
                         * Pipeline : code -> build -> automation testing -> deploy
                 * most of times sanity, regression, etc. tests will be executed on jenkins itself on headless mode by default
                 * Setup Jenkins :
                         * 1) download jenkins from website :
                                 * 1) 1 single .war file (generic java package) (web archiving file) : run through command prompt and stop when task is done, learning purpose
                                 * 2) installer .exe file : always up and running no need to stop
                         * 2) using .war file :
                                 * 1) initial setup on first execution :
                                         * go to folder where .war file is located
                                         * run the command
                                                 * java -jar jenkins.war
                                         * when executed for the first time a password will be generated copy and save it somewhere
                                         * wait until following message is visible :  Jenkins is fully up and running
                                         * minimize the command prompt and open the url : http://localhost:8080, 8080 is the default port number for jenkins
                                         * copy paste the administration password here, it will work to unlock the jenkins only once, later we create admin and user accounts
                                         * click on install suggested plugins, it install the plugins wait for some time
                                         * create the admin user name and password to open jenkins later
                                         * now jenkins is available on localhost port number 8080
                                         * the jenkins dashboard will be visible here
                                 * 2) One time configurations :
                                         * plugins :
                                                 * goto dashboard -> manage jenkins -> plugins
                                                 * goto installed plugins and verify the following plugins : git, maven
                                                 * if not installed goto available plugins search the name -> click install check box and click install button
                                         * specify java, git, maven locations :
                                                 * goto manage jenkins -> tools -> jdk installation, git installation, maven installation
                                                 * jdk : add jdk -> provide jdk name(any) and location(e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17)
                                                 * git : add jdk -> provide git name(any) and location of exe file(e.g. C:\Users\arshpreet.singh\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\bin\git.exe)
                                                 * maven : add jdk -> provide maven name(any) and location (e.g. D:\training\selenium\IdeaProjects\apache-maven-3.9.11-bin\apache-maven-3.9.11)
                 * Running github project on Jenkins :
                         * 1) Create new idem on Dashboard :
                                 * give name and select maven project
                                 * now we are on configuration page :
                                         * add optional description
                                         * in Source Code Management add git and provide the github project url, make the branch same as repository (main/master)
                                         * in Build root POM : pom.xml, Goals and options : test (we ran pom.xml using mvn test on command prompt, here it is configured for maven so only test command)
                                         * provide email address for failed builds and other details
                                         * Click on save button, it will apply the changes
                         * 2) then a new entry is created in our main dashboard open it and click on build now so that it pulls the code from github and starts execution from the pom.xml file
                         * 3) we can find the code fetched by the jenkins inside, any changes made by the test execution will be reflected here
                                 * /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/[YOUR_JOB_NAME]/
                                 * C:\Users\[USERNAME]\.jenkins\workspace\[YOUR_JOB_NAME]\
                 * Running local project on Jenkins :
                         * using local pom.xml file
                         * steps :
                                 * 1) create new item from dashboard, give it a new name and select maven project, click ok
                                 * 2) in configure do not select any source code management
                                 * 3) in builds provide the full path of the pom.xml file, in goals and options put "test", it acts as mvn test command
                                 * 4) this will replicate the run.bat file behaviour, click on apply then save
                                 * 5) click on build now and it will run the project
                         * in our case it failed so we went to opencart_local folder inside C:\Users\[USERNAME]\.jenkins\workspace\[YOUR_JOB_NAME]\
                         * opencart_local is our job name, then copy pasted the entire project files there, in pom path we placed pom.xml and clicked on build now
                 * Running run.bat file on Jenkins :
                         * we made the run.bat file to run the pom.xml file we just need to run this inside jenkins (make sure maven is installed on system)
                         * create new item from dashboard, put the name and select freestyle project(common for all types of projects)
                         * here goto build steps and click on Execute Windows batch command, specify the full location of our run.bat file
                                 * D:\training\selenium\HAF\run.bat
                         * click apply and save, then click on build now
                 * In real time : we prefer Github project execution
                         * devops team own jenkins, testing team runs the jenkins in local bowser through url from devops machine
                         * here we cannot run local projects : all the java, maven, git paths configured are of devops local machine
                         * so using Github url we can run the projects
