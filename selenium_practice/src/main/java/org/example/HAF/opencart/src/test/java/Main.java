                         * OFF
                 * Appenders and Loggers :
                         * Appenders : where to generate the logs (console/file) : file is preferred
                         * Loggers : what type of logs generate (levels : ALL < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fetal < OFF)

                         * in rolling file we specify the name of file along with time stamp, so log files will be creating with time stamp in their name
                         * in appenders ref we specify where we like to put our data in either console or file
                         * in root we can specify any of the above logging levels
                         * if file size becomes more than specified it will create a new file with the over flowing logs

                         * create Logger object () -> import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
                         * instantiate the logger object using LoggerManager -> logger= LogManager.getLogger(this.getClass()); import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
                         * now use this logger object to call its methods and log specific levels and messages

         * 3) Run tests on desired browser/cross browser/parallel : xml files should be created at the project level
                 * steps :
                         * 1) Create testng.xml file to Run Test Cases and parameterize browser name and OS to BaseClass â†’setup() method.
                         * 2) Update BaseClass -setup() method, launch browser based on conditions.
                         * 3) Maintain separate xml to run tests multiple browsers parallelly.
                 * pass the parameter in BaseClass using xml file and using switch we can dynamically choose which browser to open
                 * os is changed using grid
                 * to run multiple test cases on different browsers we can make multiple tests in xml file and provide different parameters there along thread count at suite level along with parallel="tests"

                        * 2) Also add BaseClass methods setup() & teardown() to all groups.

                         * 3) Add ExtentReportUtility (Listener class) entry in testng.xml file.
                         * 4) Make sure WebDriver is static in BaseClass, we refer same driver instance in ExtentReportUtility
                 * Also we will add the screenshot feature on failure in base class we add a method to take test method name as input take screenshot and return the path of the screenshot
                 * In ExtentReportUtility we add the methods : onStart, onTestSuccess, on TestFailure, onTestSkipped, onFinish. adding the status, info, groups of each test case along with other functionalities
                 * adding the listener xml files
                 * we need to make the BaseClass web driver static because one instance is created when execution starts from setup,
                 * but when new BaseClass() is called a driver is used in captureScreenshot method, so if web driver is nonstatic a new driver can be made
                 * and conflict can be there, to avoid it make the web driver static so it is shared across all the instances of BaseClass under one execution
                 * intentionally fail any test to check if screenshot gets attached to the report

                         * when our xml file executes the test cases the failed test cases are stored automatically in a separate xml file in the test-output folder named testng-failed.xml

                                 * 1) docker ps : which containers are already running (container id, image, command, created, status, ports, names), some may be present but not running
                                 * 2) docker run image_name : this creates the container for the particular image, if present it just creates the container, if image not present then it first downloads the image then creates the container, created containers do not run by default
                                 * 3) docker start container_id : it makes the container running
                                 * 4) docker stop container_id : it makes the container stop
                                 * 5) docker rm container_id : it removes the container, we cannot remove the running container, stop it first
                                 * 6) docker run -it image_name : it enables us to interact with container and also makes a new container and runs it
                         * Others :
                                 * 1) docker stats : tells about docker container memory usage and other stats
                                 * 2) docker system df : tells disk usage of docker images, containers, local volumes, build cache : total, active, size, reclaimable
                                 * 3) docker system prune -f : force full stopping/remove of all docker containers

                 * here we will install 3 images (image names) :
                         * 1) hub : selenium/hub
                         * 2) linux-firefox : selenium/node-firefox
                         * 3) linux-chrome : selenium/node-chrome
                 * all 3 should be part of one network
                 * 1 hub and 2 nodes
                 * run images using following commands :
                         * Create a Docker Network
                                 * docker network create grid
                                         * grid is the network name
                                         * returns ID
                         * hub :
                                 * docker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --net grid --name selenium-hub selenium/hub
                                 * docker run -d -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 --net grid --name selenium-hub selenium/hub:latest
                                         * 4442-4444:4442-4444 is the porting mechanism meaning assign port in the given range
                                         * grid is the name of network
                                         * selenium-hub is the name of node
                                         * selenium/hub is the image name
                                         * returns ID
                         * linux-chrome :
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-chrome
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub --shm-size="2g" -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-chrome:latest
                                         * grid is the network name
                                         * selenium/node-chrome is the image name
                                         * --shm-size="2g" : ?
                                         * returns ID
                         * linux-firefox :
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-firefox
                                 * docker run -d --net grid -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub --shm-size="2g" -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 selenium/node-firefox:latest
                                         * returns ID
                         * remove the network :
                                 * docker network rm grid
                 * stop containers after running tests
         * through this a network gets created, inside it a hub and two nodes of chrome and firefox are made and these containers also starts running
         * now grid environment is set up successfully now we can run our grid environment and see the nodes running, just open the http://localhost:4444/ui and hub along with nodes will be visible
         * create a xml file with parameters, listeners and everything we need, make sure that the properties file has execution_env=remote and we have a switch case for linux : Platform.LINUX
         * by default it will follow headless execution, report will be generated test wise
         * Problem with this approach :
                 * need to start and stop the hub and nodes manually each time one by one
                 * it can again be a tedious task to it every time
         * Solution :
                 * docker-compose.yaml file :
                 * it is a configuration file in which we can specify all the hub and nodes
                 * it is simple and shortcut way : need not to download images, start and stop containers manually
                 * can be placed at project level along with xml files or inside the resources folder
                 * we can add any number of nodes by just replacing the image name
                 * 1) create docker-compose.yaml file :
                         * specifying version, services (docker images to run), networks
                         * for each image we specify what we wrote in the command individually (image, ports, environment, networks)
                 * 2) run docker-compose.yaml file :
                         * docker-compose up
                 * 3) to check hub and nodes running state :
                         * http://localhost:4444/grid/console
                 * 4) to increase number of nodes
                         * docker-compose scale chrome=3
                 * 5) to stop the grid and cleanup the created container run :
                         * docker-compose down
         * Once we run this file our hub and nodes are operational, we can view them on the previous grid url, and then simply run our xml file the sessions will be created and executed as usual
